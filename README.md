# StarMap

### Description

StarMap is a constellation creation web app that empowers users to design custom constellations with personalized messages. The intuitive process involves drawing stars and lines between them, allowing users to craft unique celestial patterns, as well as allowing users to add a name, description, and position to their constellations, in order to create a truly personalized and unique night sky.

## Installation/Setup

To set up the StarMap project locally, follow these steps
- clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/Freddynnn/StarMap.git`
- install dependencies via `npm install` 
- start the frontend via  `cd StarMap/frontend && npm run start`

This will start the frontend of the StarMap project, and you can access it by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Note: The backend is already deployed, so you don't need to run it locally for the basic functionality of the frontend. If you want to run the backend locally or make changes, follow the same steps in the backend folder with the command `npm run devStart` when in the backend folder.
